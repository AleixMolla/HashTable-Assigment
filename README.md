# HashTable-Assigment

## Spooky Author Identification using Word Counting (... and also hash maps)

  Inspired by Kaggle's Spooky Author Identification challenge and the associated tutorial (https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification) you will implement a simple author 'guesser', I use guesser here because classifier is a bit strong. This guesser will use your own implementation of a hash table for counting word frequencies.

  This is my solution to the assigment in the CS-2610, DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS, has an identification efficacy of 89%.
